    <h1>I like to Paint</h1>
    <p>One of my favorite things to do it paint. I love painting with acrylics on canvas. Painting is awesome because even if you mess up, you can paint over it! Some of my favorite things to paint include:
      <ul>
        <li>Abstract</li>
         <li>Animals</li> 
         <li>Nerd stuff</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p> I love to paint things from all of my favorite fandoms. Here is an example of the types of images I like to paint: </p>

    <img src="./Fire and Blood.jpeg" width=200 height=200 />
      
    <p>I also like to paint fun animals. I often paint these types of painting to give as gifts to friends. Here is an example of a piece I did a few years ago: </p>

    <img src="./Pink Elephant.jpeg" width=200 height=200 />

    <p> Sometimes I made a collection of things. This is a collection of pieces that go together:</p>
